# SMOTE_Comparative_Analaysis
An extensive comparative analysis of the workings of the 78 variants of SMOTE on opensource software datasets. The classifiers used here are KNN and RandomForest, and the classification abilities have definitely been affected by the usage of SMOTE variants. The comparison of the variants' performance was drawn on basis of how well the classifiers were able to predict bugs after the application of variants as a mediator in the process.
